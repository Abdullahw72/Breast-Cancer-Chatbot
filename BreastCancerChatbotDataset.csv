What is the role of molecular profiling assays in the workup of breast cancer?,"Molecular profiling assays
The Onco type Dx assay (Genomic Health, Inc, Redwood City, CA) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for women with early-stage ER-positive, node-negative breast cancer treated with tamoxifen, where the recurrence score (RS) correlated with both relapse-free interval and overall survival. This assay is an RT-PCR–based assay of 21 genes (16 cancer genes and 5 reference genes) performed on paraffin-embedded breast tumor tissue.

By using a formula based on the expression of these genes, an RS can be calculated that correlates with the likelihood of distant recurrence at 10 years. Breast tumor RSs and risk levels are as follows:

< 18, low risk
18-30, intermediate risk
>30, high risk    For more visit: https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1947145-workup#c14",Role of molecular profiling assays in the workup of breast cancer.

How is invasive breast cancer treated?,"There are many treatments for invasive breast cancer. They include:

1) Surgery. A lumpectomy is a surgical procedure in which a surgeon removes the cancer and a small area of healthy tissue around it. A mastectomy may be performed after chemotherapy. This procedure removes all of your breast.

2) Chemotherapy. This drug treatment may be done before surgery to shrink the tumor and make the cancer operable. It’s also sometimes given after surgery to try to prevent the cancer from coming back.

3) Radiation. Often, radiation treatments are given after chemotherapy and surgery to prevent the cancer from coming back.

4) Hormone therapy. Certain medications may be given if the cancer cells have hormone receptors.

5) Targeted therapy. If the cancer cells have the gene HER2, you may be given drug treatments specifically for that.

What are the guidelines for breast-conserving surgery with whole-breast irradiation (WBI) in stages I and II invasive breast cancer?,"The following are guidelines, released by the Society of Surgical Oncology and the American Society for Radiation Oncology:

1) Positive margins are associated with at least a 2-fold increase in ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR)

2) Negative margins optimize IBTR; this risk is not significantly lowered by wider margin widths

3) IBTR rates are reduced with the use of systemic therapy; in patients who do not receive adjuvant systemic therapy, margins wider than no ink on tumor are not needed

4) Biologic subtypes do not indicate the need for margins wider than no ink on tumor

5) Margin width should not determine the choice of WBI delivery technique, fractionation, and boost dose.

6) Wider negative margins than no ink on tumor are not indicated for patients with invasive lobular cancer; classic lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) at the margin is not an indication for reexcision; the significance of pleomorphic LCIS at the margin is not clear

7)  Young age is associated with an increased risk for IBTR after breast-conserving therapy, an increased risk for local relapse on the chest wall after mastectomy, and adverse biologic and pathologic features; an increased margin width does not nullify the increased risk for IBTR in young patients

8) An extensive intraductal component (EIC) identifies patients who may have a large residual ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) burden after lumpectomy; when margins are negative, there is no evidence of an association between an increased risk for IBTR and EIC",Guidelines for breast-conserving surgery with whole-breast irradiation (WBI) in stages I and II invasive breast cancer.

What is the role of post lumpectomy radiation therapy in the treatment of breast cancer?,"> The purpose of radiation therapy after breast-conserving surgery is to eradicate local subclinical residual disease while reducing local recurrence rates by approximately 75%. On the basis of results from several randomized controlled studies, irradiation of the intact breast is considered standard of care, even in the lowest-risk disease with the most favorable prognostic features.

> There are 2 general approaches used to deliver radiation therapy: conventional external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and partial-breast irradiation (PBI). Whole-breast radiotherapy (WBRT) consists of EBRT delivered to the breast at a dose of 50-55 Gy over 5-6 weeks.

In EBRT, a beam of radiation, a high-energy X-ray, is focused on the spot where the cancer was removed. If a lumpectomy was performed, a patient may receive EBRT to the entire breast, a technique called whole-breast radiation. EBRT may also be delivered to nearby lymph nodes. Some advantages of EBRT for breast cancer patients may include:

1) It is fast, painless and performed as an outpatient procedure.
2) Unlike chemotherapy, which circulates throughout the body, EBRT is targeted to the treatment area.

How is locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) and inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) treated?,"LABC is often treated with a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy.

 NOTE: Chemotherapy is not given every day but instead is given in cycles. A cycle of chemotherapy refers to the time it takes to give the chemotherapy and then allow the body to recover. A cycle of chemotherapy typically ranges from two to four weeks.

The treatment of inflammatory breast cancer is similar to that of other types of locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). Treatment usually includes neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy. As with other forms of LABC, two types of chemotherapy agents (anthracyclines and a taxane) are usually used. Once the diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is established, it is important to proceed rapidly to treatment, as this is considered a rapidly spreading cancer.

There are some important differences in the treatment of IBC compared with LABC. In IBC, a mastectomy is usually recommended, even if the cancer responded well to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After mastectomy, radiation therapy to the chest wall and lymph nodes is strongly recommended. Immediate reconstruction is NOT recommended in IBC.

Those with clinically negative nodes may undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy before they start treatment, or else sentinel node determination may be delayed until after treatment is completed. In general, the best single test for evaluating the status of measurable tumor is ultrasonography (preferably done by the same operator). The mass often appears larger on physical examination than on ultrasonography, which can more effectively discriminate hypoechoic masses from surrounding stroma or hematoma. In IBC, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be an important adjunct to response assessment.

PARP stands for poly-ADP ribose polymerase. It’s a protein that helps cells repair themselves if they become damaged. PARP inhibitors stop the PARP from repairing cancer cells.

Two inherited altered genes that increase the risk of breast cancer developing are called BRCA1 and BRCA2. Cancer cells with faulty BRCA genes are already less able to repair themselves if they become damaged.

However, the dogmatic belief that one should never operate in the setting of metastatic disease has certainly been dispelled in favor of critical evaluation of whether surgically achieved local control can lead to improved survival as a part of multimodal treatment.

What is the role of tamoxifen and raloxifene for the reduction of breast cancer risk?,"
Two selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), tamoxifen and raloxifene, are approved for reduction of breast cancer risk in high-risk women. Two NSABP trials (P1 and P2) showed that tamoxifen reduced the risk of DCIS and invasive breast cancer by 30-50%. In the NSABP P2 prevention trial, raloxifene was as effective as tamoxifen in reducing the risk of invasive breast cancer but was 30% less effective than tamoxifen in reducing the risk of DCIS. Tamoxifen and raloxifene are equally effective in reducing the risk of ER-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Raloxifene is associated with lower rates of thromboembolic disease, benign uterine conditions, and cataracts than tamoxifen is. The evidence does not allow determination of whether either agent decreases mortality from breast cancer.",role of tamoxifen and raloxifene for the reduction of breast cancer risk. what role does tamoxifen and raloxifene play for the reduction of breast cancer risk. ,tamoxifen raloxifene,https://www.medscape.com/answers/1947145-155372/what-is-the-role-of-tamoxifen-and-raloxifene-for-the-reduction-of-breast-cancer-risk
What are the ASCO guidelines for the pharmacologic reduction of breast cancer risk?,"ASCO guidelines on endocrine therapy to reduce breast cancer risk recommend the following :

1) In premenopausal women who are at least 35 years old and have completed childbearing, tamoxifen (20 mg/day for 5 years) remains the standard of care for risk reduction. Low-dose tamoxifen (5 mg/day) may be an alternative in women with intraepithelial neoplasia.

2) Anastrozole, exemestane, or raloxifene should not be prescribed for breast cancer risk reduction in premenopausal women.

3) In postmenopausal women, the choice of endocrine therapy includes anastrozole (1 mg/day) in addition to exemestane (25 mg/day), raloxifene (60 mg/day), or tamoxifen (20 mg/day).

What is the role of postoperative imaging in the monitoring of metastatic breast cancer?,"Recommendations for monitoring disease response in the metastatic setting vary. In general, monthly evaluations consisting of a history and physical examination to evaluate progression of disease and toxicities are reasonable.

Measurement of tumor markers, such as CEA, CA15.3, and CA27.29, can be used in conjunction with diagnostic imaging, history, and physical examination for monitoring patients on active therapy. CA15.3 and CA27.29 levels correlate with the course of disease in 60-70% of patients, whereas CEA levels correlate in 40% of patients.

However, data are insufficient to recommend the use of CEA, CA15.3, or CA27.29 alone for monitoring response to treatment. Caution should be used in the interpretation of rising CEA, CA15.3, or CA27.29 levels during the first 4-6 weeks of a new therapy; spurious early rises may occur.",role of postoperative imaging in the monitoring of metastatic breast cancer.
